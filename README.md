# Project 4: Agent and Agency

For this project we will consider the web site/application not as a mechanism or machine but as an agent or actor on behalf of others. While traditionally a software agent or bot has a particular technical definition we will look at this concept a bit more broadly. You might consider this agent working on behalf of a viewer/user of your site or you might consider it working on your behalf to generate art, collect data, mitigate communication etc. 

How does distinguishing our code as an actor or entity change our relationship with it? When we designate an agent what becomes of our own agency?

One of your first tasks in creating this project should be to set a scope for your agent. Keep it contrained. You are not expected create anything approaching artificial intelligence. You agent might react to very specific needs in very rudimentary but still useful ways.

This project should rely on a combination of all three of the tools we have looked at so far: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because an agent must execute commands or anticipate needs or react to input this project will focus on your new experience with JavaScript.
