# Project 4: Agent and Agency

For this project we will consider the web site/application not as a mechanism or machine but as an agent or actor working on behalf of ourselves or others to do something creative.

While traditionally a software agent or bot has a particular technical definition we will look at this concept a bit more broadly. You might consider this agent working on behalf of a viewer/user of your site or you might consider it working on your behalf to generate art, collect data, mitigate communication etc. Your agent shouldn't assist with or automate some creative task.

**How does distinguishing our code as an actor or entity change our relationship with it?** **When we designate an agent what becomes of our own agency?**
**Is it possible for a website or code to be creative?**

One of your first tasks in creating this project should be to set a scope for your agent. Keep it constrained. You are not expected create anything approaching artificial intelligence. You agent might react to very specific needs in very rudimentary but still useful or interesting ways.

This project should rely on a combination of all three of the tools we have looked at so far: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because an agent must execute commands or anticipate needs or react to input this project will focus on your new experience with JavaScript. Other options include creating a twitter bot using Google Sheets or using IFTTT or DO to execute commands for you.
